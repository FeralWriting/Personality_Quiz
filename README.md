# Personality Quiz

Find what kind of plant you are based on what technology you like! A Buzzfeed inspired three question personality quiz on a single webpage. This quiz allows the user to input their preference for each question, and get a unique response based on the answers. This project used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project gave me experience with using javascript for web developement, site interactivity, and using Glitch as an IDE. Take the quiz here: https://personality-quiz-amali.glitch.me/.

## Features

Some notable features in this project are the "clear answer" and "restart quiz" buttons.

After the user answers a question, the answers for that question become unclickable. However, if they change their mind and would like to change their answer, they can click "clear answer" and will have the ability to choose again. They can do this as many times as they need.

Also, if the user finishes the quiz and wants to pick different answers, instead of refreshing the page, or clicking "clear answer" on every single question, there is a provided "restart quiz" button.
